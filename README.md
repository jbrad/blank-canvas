# Blank Canvas Child Theme

## Description

This is a custom child theme kit for [Standard](http://standardtheme.com), crafted by [Jason Bradley](http://everchangingmedia.com).

The [Blank Canvas](https://github.com/eightbit/standard-child-themes/tree/master/blank-canvas) requires Standard 3.

## Installation

*Note: Standard 3 must be installed first for the Blank Canvas to work correctly.*

There are two ways to install WordPress themes / child themes: via the WordPress Dashboard (recommended) and via FTP. 

### Using the WordPress Dashboard

1. Download the [Blank Canvas](https://github.com/eightbit/standard-child-themes/tree/master/blank-canvas).
2. Locate the "Appearance" menu.
3. In the "Appearance" menu, click on "Themes".
4. On the "Themes" page, click on the "Install Themes" tab.
5. Click on the "Upload" link at the top of the page.
6. On the "Upload" page, locate the theme / child theme archive (zip) on your computer and click "Install Now".
7. On the following page, click "Activate".

### Using FTP

1. Download the [Blank Canvas](https://github.com/eightbit/standard-child-themes/issues/new).
2. Unzip the ```blank-canvas.zip``` archive on your computer.
3. Connect to your server via FTP.
4. Upload the extracted ```blank-canvas``` directory to the ```/wp-content/themes/``` directory on your server.
6. In the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to the "Themes" page under the "Appearance" menu.
7. Locate "Blank Canvas" and click "Activate".

## Usage

Find the ```style.css``` file for the Blank Canvas and locate the "Customizations" section. You can add your own styles under this section to override the styles that come with Standard.

If you happened to name Standard 3 theme directory anything else besides "standard" when you installed the theme, you will need to update the "Template" name and the ```@import``` path in the child theme's ```style.css``` in order for it to work correctly.
